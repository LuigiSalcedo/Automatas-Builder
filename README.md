You have to compile and run the main.go file to use the program.

You can download an install Go from the official page: https://go.dev

In folder named "files" there is an file with the name (0,1)-(0)(0).graph this is an example of an automata that
accept any string that ends with 01 using the Alphabet E = {0, 1}. The name of the file is like a regular
expression [0-1]*[0][1], but the file name really doesn't matter.

This program is not complete and some features are not yet implemented.
