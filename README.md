# Automatas-Builder
This repository contains a project used to create and test differents automatas.

You have to compile and run the main.go file to use the program.

You can download and install Go from the official page: https://go.dev

In the folder named "files" there is a file with the name "(0,1)-(0)(0).graph" this is an example of an automata that
accept any string that ends with "01" using the Alphabet E = {0, 1}. The name of the file is like the regular
expression -> [0-1]*[0][1], but the file name really doesn't matter.

This program is not complete and some features are not yet implemented.
